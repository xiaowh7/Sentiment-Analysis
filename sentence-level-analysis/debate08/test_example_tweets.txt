Are you following the #debate08 thread?
McCain's solution to diplomacy is to not talk to the parties involved and have a New World Order that bosses the world. Brilliant. #current
"@stevenbjohnson he said ""don't torture... ever again."" pretty clearly. #debate08"
"@Imarilove yes, I'm looking at my next college course, I have to write an 8 page paper this time.. gah."
"@janoss - re: emotive - neither candidate has it, but I met Obama in Chicago...so I'm biased. Obama likes to meet eye-to-eye."
#current I don't think McC understands how the UN works!
"McCain stuck in time warp, mistakes name-dropping Kissinger & old vacay itineraries for contemporary foreign policy. #debate08 #momocrats"
@Imarilove I won't vote for him as dogcatcher.
@mkantonelli what on :)
CNN played Kissinger's response proving McCains answer correct. #debate08
the debate was a draw.  I thought Mccain did come out slightly on top because he sounded more educated on the issues. good closing.#debate08
@stillgray Obama claims that they'll be another Holocaust - what he doesn't mention outright is he wants to be Hitler!

#debate08 I love watching comments roll in on Twitter's Election2008!
"@lindagoin To be honest, I've never had much passion for Obama. I just can't stand McCain anymore.  Obama's been growing on me though lately"
Kissinger changes what he said about discussions with Iran in order to support his boy. #current
"#debate08 McCain: ""we send $700B to countries that don't like us."" Fed Govt only sends $39B in foreign aid, his # is what we spend on oil."
#debate08 McCain's temper and disrespect fit nicely with the new image of the US that the Bush administration has built up for the world.
@Imarilove Practice? He's had how many years in Washington to practice??
"@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight."
"@AFashionista, really? Did he not mention that he's a war hero yet again? How's that good? #debate08"

@seasonothebitch Laugh Out Loud
"#debate08 4 years ago repubs were worried McCain might b vp for Kerry, he's so centrist. Now dems say he's Bush-close. Irrational"
#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.
"@stillgray exactly no diplomacy. war, war, war.....http://www.newamericancentury.org/ #current"
@Condoulo  oh crap I dont do that either.... I just stand there. guess you lost all respect for me too... anyway exactly what I thought. ...

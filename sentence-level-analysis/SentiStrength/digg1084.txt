 4	 1	He has a beautiful family photo! : )
 2	 2	Well, got to respect the guy for owning up to it. Too bad he called it bad judgment. He had a chance to become a poor but prominent spokesman for decriminalizing pot. <br><br>We can't afford the on drugs like we're going. Save prison for violent offenders, not pot smokers. 
 1	 3	watch out guys, japanese girls get pissed off and become extremely violent when getting ketchup on her clothes. 
 1	 3	fæces
 2	 2	While this does look good, I wouldn't write out Waltz with Bashir or Fears of the Dark just yet
 2	 3	Of course. Because rendition and secret torture prisons are so American and such a change from Bush. More 'Change' you won't believe!
 1	 2	Public Figure = Public Domain. <br><br>Continue to do whatever the hell you want with his image. Those 'er the breaks when you become a public figure. 
 2	 3	Better than the 'Let's drive Hummers and fuck up the world' bandwagon.
 2	 3	first, i don't own an iphone, but....<br><br>i always download a cracked copy of any software i might use prior to buying it. too many times i've found badly written programs that were bug ridden, failed to live up to their hype, or simply outright junk. when i do find an app i like, i pay for it - that way i can take up any problems with the developer, feel confident talking on a ng (yeah, i love the people who complain their software isn't working properly only to discover the crack hasn't activated some part of it!)<br><br>so sure, try the cracked version - but if you like it, pay for it!
 2	 1	Article author: Lucy Cockcroft.<br><br>(stifled, juvenile laughter)
 1	 3	Leona Helmsley went to jail for tax evasion. Others get Cabinet positions. Hah!!
 1	 4	It only stimulates the economy if you make tax cuts and increase spending at the same time, which is what you're talking about.<br><br>The only problem is that it stimulates the economy at the expense of the future. You can't cut taxes and increase spending indefinitely. Despite what Cheney claimed about increased GDP making up for the shortfall... that's a ponzi scheme and he's a moron.<br>
 3	 2	Heroes one was ok, absolutely ridiculous, but ok. 
 1	 3	The commercials were worse than the actual show.
 1	 3	You lay, you pay.
 1	 1	Sixburgh!
 1	 4	This is a sad, sad story. If we ever hope to have a futuristic society with flying cars and no war or sickness we have to make some very drastic changes, and ending this bullshit is one of them. Not that we will any time soon...
 1	 1	whos Kevin...<br> - oh wait
 2	 2	yeah! down with big corporations. lets let more ma and pop businesses into the scene
 1	 2	Psst... you're trying too hard.
 1	 4	Hi Mowe,<br><br>I do have a few questions. I understand that in Islam, you must believe in all that is taught by the prophet and cannot disagree lest you are no longer a Muslim. Is that correct?<br><br>1 - If so, how do you feel about the duty of the husband to discipline his wife via physical beatings?<br><br>2 - How do you feel about the doctrine that explains it is ok for a man to have several wives and for the marriage of little girls of 9 and 10 years to middle aged men? (a few weeks back a Judge refused to annul a marriage in Saudi Arabia when the mother pleaded for her 10 year old girl who was married off to the fathers' 47 year old friend as repayment for a debt)<br><br>3 - How do you feel about the fact that your testimony is worth half that of a man's?<br><br>4 - How do you feel about Muhammad's doctrine that allows for temporary marriages in order to allow his soldiers to have sex with women and then leave them with no rights after the temporary marriage is over (mind you this still goes on in certain Muslim countries).<br><br>These are just a few examples of what I view as unreasonable demands of Islam.<br><br>I can't answer your question as to why people convert to Islam - people convert to Scientology as well even though so many consider it a dangerous cult.<br><br>I have however heard too many stories of those who left Islam, especially women and their stories of abuse and subjugation are horrific.<br><br>
 1	 3	Considering the DHS has send undercover agents into the likes of Code Pink, this really doesn't need to have a reasonable explanation. This is par for the course.
 1	 1	That's why he keeps rewarding them with Super Bowl wins.
 1	 1	I have this feeling that I just saw a glimpse of the future right then.
 1	 4	This story isn't about marijuana. Even if its legalized SWAT teams will continue to execute no-knock warrants when going after cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, meth, pcp, etc. and continue to abuse their power and authority the way they did here. If that box had contained a kilo of cocaine and the owner of the house wasn't the mayor of the town but just some random citizen unlucky enough to have their address picked by the drug dealers as a drop then you'd probably never hear this story. The cops would just lie like they apparently did both in getting the warrant (it wasn't a no-knock warrant) and trying to cover up after the fact (claiming the man opened the door then slammed it in the cops face, that the dogs were threatening the cops, etc).<br><br>Legalizing marijuana won't stop this abuse by the police. It'll just remove one of the many reasons they have to abuse their power. 
 1	 3	Because they understood the basics of US politics:<br>- Wave bible in front of crowd!<br>- Promise them tax cuts and more guns<br>- Tell them that USA is #1!<br><br>Repeat and rinse until a seat in congress has been secured!<br>
 1	 3	so if you're a government official, someone can use you, your face, and likeness for anything they want, without you having any kind of input whatsoever?
 1	 2	It's a big deal in that most people assume that 'successful people' don't. 
 2	 2	The only time I use e-mail these days is at work... and rarely will I curse there. Generally, that's not a good idea unless you're really comfortable with who you're e-mailing.<br><br>Now, as for in IM or IRC... like a fuckin' sailor.
 1	 3	One more reason NOT to use Comcast?
 1	 3	I just choose 'Inaccurate' when I bury it.
 2	 1	knowing how to bet/when to bet can make people think you have a good hand even if you don't. so you don't need a good hand to win a hand.<br><br>Sometimes even if you bet right you can still lose. similar to football or something wide reviever with more skill can generally escape the defense but will never catch 100% of passes thrown to them.
 1	 4	Does the religious right have the right when the liberal left tries to pawn their 'Evolution' bullshit onto them to tell them that they ARE wrong, WILL NOT tolerate their bullshit and that they can FUCK OFF?
 1	 4	Don't worry, the douchebag Biden will tell it on Oprah...
 1	 3	Maybe they would have $$$ left if they didn't bribe the distribution companies to follow the Blew-Ray path.
 1	 4	Man, life is a bitch. 
 1	 1	More like M OR M instead of &amp;
 1	 4	If your family was killed in a war would you then think that killing innocent civilians would be a good idea? If you answer yes you have no moral compass
 1	 4	Digg needs to start banning for the god damn ascii's .. they're annoying as hell.
 1	 4	And I give a fuck because?
 1	 1	An M1911.
 4	 1	how can they forget the first ninja gaiden. that was a great ending. pretty graphic intense for NES at the time.
 2	 3	this waiting is killing me!!! :D
 1	 3	yeah let's ban everything but victory gin.<br><br>war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength
 2	 3	I'm all for this plan. I love love love his analogies. But these ideas will only come to pass when the vampires(board of directors and corrupt/silly politicians) have sucked the last dollar out of the economy. It's funny though that when they're the only ones left with money it will no longer have any value.
 1	 1	Coraline is a book.
 2	 2	That show was the sole reason I went to Hulu to begin with because my local blockbuster refused to stock it. 
 2	 2	so sick! 
 1	 2	Are you sure? Looks like his helicopter is malfunctioning.
 1	 1	Elaborate on how the dinosaurs are not in the Bible?
 3	 1	God, how I would love to untie that bowtie of hers.
 1	 3	if i send them a brick or some dog turd, i wonder how much it'd be valued at
 2	 3	I know other people have said it, but I really don't think this your typical scam...If you send your property away without knowing what it is worth and you blindly accept what someone says it is worth then you are a fool and more power to cash4gold.<br><br>Is this really that different than a best buy extended service plan? or upgrading your ram through Dell when you buy a new computer? or getting that 'rustproofing' for your new car?<br><br>Full-tilt capitalism maybe, but scam? ehhhhh
 1	 3	As title suggests, it is several 'missing links' of a very big, very disturbing puzzle..The links usually not discussed as 'acceptable' truths, links conveniently left out of other documentaries.. CIA? don't think so. The rabbit hole goes much deeper than 1 single film could ever be capable of. Missing Links highlights several culprits behind the curtain hidden safely in shadows of this fraud of the century. <br><br>PNAC is the cornerstone to 9/11. Just ask Sibel Edmonds Ashcroft invoked the 'state secrets' privilege on her to silence her completely and prevent her from revealing the truth of their crime networks and weapons/arms trading profiteer deals. They are afraid of her speaking in a court of law, under oath, of what she knows of this cover-up. What have they got to hide? Why such intense secrecy. Is this how an innocent party acts? 9/11 is a trans-national scandal that would embarrass far too many 'important' people.<br><br>Any wonder why this PNAC 'think tank' group and their 'new Pearl Harbor' to put our major-theater war manifesto in motion- 'coincidence' was never investigated, questioned, held to account, probed, much less mentioned or analyzed in the slightest by the usual paid-for talking pundits on controlled fake 'news' networks to speak of..
 1	 3	You should read and study the Bible in its entirety before you say anything like that. At least do your research or something. Man, what a waste of diggs from other people...<br><br>Ignorance is bliss but it's not useful.
 2	 2	Yeah, all 7 seasons of MacGyver were really MasterCard commercials too!
 1	 4	Have you walked down the streets of Seoul as a white man with a short haircut? No, then stfu. The rest of your rant is off subject.
 2	 2	thats the thing, it wont happen here because we have guns.<br><br>and people wonder why we like our gun rights.
 1	 2	So if you sold your house for $1, and then decided 10 years later you wanted it back, someone should just hand it over to you?
 1	 3	Since when did football become a non-aggressive sport, and Cardinals fans just face the fact that your defense just couldn't pull it out because if they did you all wouldn't be crying about it. Arizona had plenty of chances to win this game including the interception that went back for a touchdown before half, if they get 7 there the Cardinals probably win this game. Besides what affect did Harrison have on the outcome of this game after the interception return...Nothing. So throw him out and you still lost.  Nobody can just enjoy the game i guess...typical of internet forums and digg.
 1	 4	Oh please. Every other OS in the world handles this better than Vista. This is microsoft catering to the shit for brains users out there who click on every flashing banner on the net and then blame microsoft for providing an insecure system. Why should I be inconvenienced because of them? There are plenty of people who know how to use their system properly and even run their machine without anti-virus/spyware software without any problems. You know why? Because they're not fucking retarded. <br><br>I bet your one of those people who drink a bottle of draino unless the warning label said not to. I don't want my OS holding my hand for me. 
 2	 2	I would have to say I'm torn on the issue. On one hand, I like the idea of having work to do here in the US. I like money, I like having a job. And when people buy from my company (an American one), I get to keep my job. I know there's all sorts of talk from people about how 'oh protectionism doesn't work!' Reality is: if my company doesn't make money, they lay off tons of people. Which they have done and continue to do.<br><br>There should be incentive to keeping jobs in the US, and it shouldn't come at just a monetary price tag. Unfortunately, it's all about the money. And if there's no money to be made here, then there's no reason to have companies here.<br><br>We have nothing to export. We don't have tons of cheap labor. We can't survive on $2/day like they can in some of these nations. We've built regulations into our system to protect our workers and our consumers. We can't just go throwing lead paint into toys and poisons into toothpaste to reduce the cost of production.<br><br>Unfortunately, as a result of this and the result of the ability to communicate and travel to far off nations there's no incentive at all to have jobs here when you can make significantly more money doing it elsewhere.<br><br>So yes, I believe we need some way to enforce some minor protectionism in our economy. I'm not saying cut off completely import and export or anything of that nature. But I'm saying there needs to be incentive to stay focused on our country. There's nothing wrong with this. Most other countries have a protectionist policy when it comes to their workforce and it works out very well for them.
 4	 1	Christian Bale kicks fucking ass!
 2	 3	Yeah, I'm sure she gave it to one of her friends - I have some doubt that four high school senior girls from an upscale community all had their own cellphones. /sarcasm<br><br>I'm from Rochester too. I always said (before texting came to be as big as it is) that it's not TALKING on the phone while driving that's a problem, it's DIALING.<br><br>
 3	 1	Dude, it's just like in Gate Keepers 21. Now, if you could just control -when- the phone explodes, and look good in a skirt, this could be the best thing ever.
 1	 1	Spray-painted lead.
 3	 1	Some people play to be competitive or to be creative. Sure, those things are fun in themselves but only to certain people. What detour is getting at here is that they just play the game without worries simply to have fun, not to be the best (or even any good, for that matter).
 1	 3	hes not a great actor, gets everything he wants, people drool over everything he does, surprise, you've created a monster.
 1	 4	And more morons will buy it.
 1	 3	'However I wish he had pulled a Bill O'<br><br>But isn't that what this is anyway?<br>
 1	 3	You may want to watch this television ad that is playing.  Then join the blogs and fight to bring America back to common sense.<br><br>
 3	 3	IE6 is pretty quick to boot on windows machines, would never use it for a browsing session, but i can usually use it to check a page before ff even loads. (uni thin systems are fairly slow on i/o)
 2	 4	For most people, its a search engine, nothing more. For those stupid enough to have bought into the whole Web 2.0 Cloud bollocks then yes, they're going to be in the shit. Or not. Those who will really be in the shit are the Google Doccers daft enough not to have local copies and corporates stupid enough to be running their email system on Gmail. <br><br>The rest of us will just go 'meh' and use something else.<br><br>I don't use Gmail, I don't use Google Apps. If Google disappeared completely, I'd just click on the down arrow next to the Google icon in the search box of Firefox and choose another from the list, that's how completely and utterly irrelevent Google is in my life. If it's there I'll use it, if it isn't, I'll use something else. Recently though, I have been using something else - ixquick - and it seems to be better than Google.
 1	 3	Daschle withdrew, so should the Sect. of the treasury...
 2	 4	All of you idiot nutcases posting anti-marijuana propaganda from government websites, you need to watch a BBC documentary called Should I Smoke Dope? It was done by a journalist who compared pot to alcohol. She smoked different types, and performed all sorts of experiments while intoxicated. Guess what? EVERYTHING that our government is telling us about pot is a LIE, Her conclusion was that pot is less harmful than alcohol.
 1	 4	Yeah, OUR money. Where was all of the debate &amp; discourse when the Bailout Bill was passed in a record wee's time? This is absurd. Are we all so exhausted from being forecefully bent over We can't recognize when We're being RUN OVER?
 2	 2	And we dont die, as you can see in the end of the commercial.
 1	 1	can i see the video
 1	 3	Who gives a shit what the GOP thinks? They compromised in the house for the GOP and not one republican voted for it.
 1	 1	plm cate cielo-uri si matizuri din romania sunt facute altundeva?..
 1	 4	It is fairly ridiculous that on my shitty HTC WinMo phone I have a full browser with flash. Hell Adobe already has flash in preparation(if not done) for WinMo. Give me a break apple and let go of the leash. <br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong about the flash on Windows Mobile.
 3	 2	No, games aren't responsible - we are responsible. It's our choice...
 2	 3	Incorrect^<br><br>1) The evidence that suggests PEDs make a pitcher throw harder is substantially weak. The sentence you're responding to ('chemically enhanced pitches') was a figure of speech -- PEDs help pitchers reduce fatigue as the season wears on, thus making them more effective in the later months than they otherwise would be. Example: Ryan Franklin 2003. He had a career year where he was able to throw 200+ innings of quality pitching despite *zero* enhancement to his 'stuff,' was busted in 2004, and has since found starting significantly more difficult and has been relegated to a relief role.<br><br>2) Velocity induces *vastly* more swinging strikes than it does turning ordinary flyballs into home runs. If anything, a fastball with more zip on it because of PEDs would hurt Barry more often that it would help him, as it would all hitters.<br><br>^This sentence may be factually correct but the insinuation behind it is wrong.
 1	 1	i us them and thy deliverd
 2	 3	VitriolAndAngst, you said: 'Cuba, is under a damn embargo from the US for the past 40 years. It has NOTHING to do with trade restrictions.'<br><br>An embargo IS a set of trade restrictions. Judging from your other incoherent comments in this thread, however, I'll forgive your mistake as simply a product of your elementary nature.<br><br>Intrepidia is exactly right. Relying only on domestic production is terrible for an economy. You can also check out North Korea.
 3	 1	Actually, I've been a fan for close to 25 years, and indeed there were a few photos there which I haven't seen before.
 3	 2	NO! i am! lol
 3	 1	And I thought the original sound recording was hilarious!<br><br>Now we just need a mash-up of him and O'Reilly.
 3	 3	The funny thing is if there were to be a picture of him with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, no one would have said anything
 4	 1	If nvidia sold those today, I would buy one. Pair that with Windows 7, and you have a great HTPC.
 2	 3	blue stinger was fun but made absolutely no sense. most confusing game i ever played and that includes metal gear solid 2.
 1	 2	well maybe it has something to do with the fact that the title says 'concept'
 1	 3	Nothing wrong with options... that work.
 1	 3	Clearly the only way that noumuon can make friends is by making fun of everyone else and hoping that people will like him for it.
 1	 4	'I don't want to be walking to the shops in fear that granny is packing.'<br><br>And what precisely do you have to fear from granny packing? Do you think that the instant someone starts carrying a firearm they become a ranting, raving, murderous maniac? On the other hand, someone willing to commit the crime of murder probably isn't going to worry a whole lot about getting charged for an illegal gun, so any idiotic gun bans aren't going to do anything to stop them.
 1	 3	Pretty useless all my incoming mail goes in one category anyway, Porn.
 3	 1	I've been visiting Shacknews since it was called Shugashack and before that, Quakeholio. I hope Steve and co stick around!
 2	 1	See <br><br>It's based on accusations, not trials.
 2	 2	Can someone put this article in movie form for us Americans?
1	 3	And tie you to a dugout beam with duct tape.
 2	 3	-Cops arresting someone (translated to English)- (And yes I know this was just a gift)<br><br>Cop: Did you really think you were going to outrun us? Have you seen our cars?<br><br>Arrestee: I'm sorry officer, I don't know what I was thinking. I don't wanna go to jail.<br><br>Cop: Yeeeeeahhhh... Well we kiiiiiinda blew our entire budget for the year on these cars. We can't really afford to put you somewhere. But we sure did catch you in style right? Just don't do it again.
 1	 1	Blago-loco.
 2	 1	I like the idea of that they can be replenished in seconds with a new cartridge of methanol, but is that something an owner can do or does it have to be professionally done? And what is the battery life?
 1	 3	These comments suck.
 4	 1	Ahaha Loved the sumo one
 3	 1	a lil krazy just like my football
 1	 3	Dagger, the Verses of the Rajim most probably existed, but even if they had, they would now be abrogated.<br><br>This is still irrelevant. Curtis said 'Muslim world', not 'Muslim religion'. Are you claiming stoning is prominent in any other culture?
 4	 1	Cool. Since Joomla supports mootools li by default, this means I can use this technique to integrate Flash into Joomla and will become a Joomla-Builder with Flash in a pocket. Thanks!
 2	 3	your right, maybe we should all be really cool and talk about how great pot is and how much we love it because we're so awesome.
 1	 3	Your digg tells me as much as this comment tells you:<br><br>iajdsiofajsu32i09321 oifdas0ifas908 2309oijdf!!!! iaso9034 ()*1092839()*wsads!!!! Hooray!!!0912091823jkasdaopd
 2	 2	He didn't even need to read the article, the title was enough.
 2	 3	About time i heard a bit of news on this in Bale's favour, the fact that everyone considers this supposed 'meltdown' news is pretty much beyond comprehension.. Important scene, Idiot DP mucking around in the back, i hope he never gets work again in this field of work.
 3	 1	It looks like the sheep is laughing about it in the picture.
 2	 3	The fact that it promotes Islam isn't what's shocking, it's the fact that it's 'hidden' and not obviously a religious product. If it did say 'Christianity is the light' it would either be obvious on the front that it was religious, or it would probably be just as controversial.<br><br>*Edit* I did a bit of research, apparently there's a lot of controversy over whether it's actually saying 'Islam is the Light' or not, so I have to say this is probably just a gross overreaction. Grow up, soccer moms!
 3	 1	i've seen them demoed in book stores.<br>maybe you should get the ebook for free when you buy a book.<br><br>
 4	 1	No way, Scandinavia has some of the fastest internet around.
 1	 4	I don't see how it couldn't suck, unless they load Robert Downey Jr. up with as many narcotics as his body can handle, let him come out on stage in his Tropic Thunder blackface getup, drinking thunderbird wine, and give his acceptance speech in ebonics laced with dead Heath Ledger jokes. 
 1	 3	Price drop is a huge fix for me. $59.00 for new games? Seriously?
 1	 3	Aeroflot? More like AeroFLOP!
 1	 2	They actually had a prosecution in the Lowcountry (beach area for you out-of-staters) a year or two ago for that.
 3	 1	And you know what? Thats ok... 
 1	 3	People still give a shit about Scott Stapp and Chad Kroeger? Last I heard Creed broke up about 5 years ago.<br>You're living in the past, dude.
 1	 3	Did you just really use the non-word, 'doosh?'<br><br>Wow. How ironic.
 2	 2	It's San Fransisco's way of getting back at the nation.
 2	 2	Crap, I didn't even get that at first. I really need to learn about this 'math' thing someday.
 1	 2	It's an economic trap!
 1	 3	I don't see how it matters who does the talking, so long as what's said is true. Both sides are largely comprised of stupid politicians or evil politicians pandering to stupid voters.
 1	 2	BlacklabelSAR, I appreciate your desire to join in the pile-on, but in this case you're wrong. I'm fully aware that Godwin's Law simply states the probability of a Nazi reference, and nothing else. However, as I'm sure you are aware, the most common corollary to Godwin's Law is that whoever makes the Nazi comparison loses the discussion.<br><br>99% of the time when Godwin's Law is invoked, the person using it means the corollary. I don't think it's necessary or helpful to force everybody to say, 'The most common corollary to Godwin's Law! You lose!' It's pedantic and artificial, and nothing is gained by it.<br><br>Lastly, I think you should all be grateful to me for providing you with such a comedy goldmine.
 1	 2	Same reason people endorsed Bush's illegal policy.
 2	 2	Hmm seemed funnier in my head.
 3	 1	Eminem really is quite a genius. Also, his public persona is not at all the same as his real personality. He is actually a somewhat quiet, nice guy. Of course, people only see the public side of a celebrity.
 1	 4	FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK<br><br>Watch it get postponed again i swear to god....<br><br>Government and specific people are fucking idiots.<br>
 2	 1	sorry about the double post, but here is a much better representation of the game, shows also how it sounds if you miss the targets:
 1	 2	Batshit insane?
 1	 2	Profit by investigating for months (and in detail) who wore the strap-on.
 1	 2	Won't kill us necessarily. A lot of scientists say that it will cause a lot of deaths but the most likely scenario is that the field won't collapse entirely, it will merely be confused (and intensity will decrease somewhat) for a while (as in, two north or two south poles for a couple days or weeks). 
 1	 2	It's true thet world can end at any moment without warning. That's why I always tell people exactly what I think of them because I may never get another chance.
 2	 3	The first people Hitler murdered on a large scale were the mentally handicapped as they didn't meet his expectations of a 'master race'. The German people were furious and rose up against this aprobation and it soon stopped. The next group of people to be exterminated were not the Jews or communists or homosexuals: it was the intelligentsia. The people who knew the program and where it was headed. Some were teachers and university professors. Today there are few teachers or professors in this country bright enough or deprogrammed enough to be a threat to anyone. However I was blessed to by surrounded by over 15,000 of the intelligentsia on 9/2/08 in St.Paul, Minnesota. And I knew it was just the tip of the iceberg. <br>Hitler took everyone's guns before the roundup so his pussy gestapo agents could do their job easier. Does FEMA et al really think the REAL Americans are as quick to surrender as the Germans? Do they really think we're going to go down without a fight? <br>Thanks for the post. Do not stop talking about this to your fellow Americans. 
 2	 3	I understand it's an unstated digg etiquette to close your comments with /sarcasm if you meant to be sarcastic. Trolls have unfortunately killed the subtleties of language.<br><br>Cheers!
 1	 2	Yes, yes they did.<br><br>After breaking in and stealing it from the UN.<br><br>...only so that they could 'distribute' the food to their political allies and leave the rest to starve.<br><br><br>This is the 5th time you've posted this contradictory story. Quit spamming it and go home.
 3	 1	welcome to digg
 1	 2	same here, i'm not able to see new shouts most of the time
 1	 2	The Volt? When? The Volt keeps getting pushed into the future. The only reason they might actually produce it is they're getting desperate, as they can't seem to compete with the Japanese companies in the traditional car market.
 1	 1	How about some Albert Lee?
 4	 1	DIG THIS^^^ UP this guy has talent and people should have the oppurtunity to see/hear him play also it's a cover of ronald jenkees 'a fun beat from outer space' ronald jenkees is even more incredible check them both out.
 1	 2	Captain Picard causes the destruction of all of humanity. He did it before, he's doing it now and he'll do it again!
 2	 2	Are you thinking about those 10-10-220, telephone commercials? He talks about that here: <br><br> 'I made an album in Las Vegas in the '60s, and a hippie friend said to me, 'Man, you sold out.' So I said, 'wait a minute, what is that over there?' And he said, 'It's a phone, man.' I said, 'That's Ma Bell. You're cooperating with them. You have one of their implements in your home. You sold out.' By that I mean that this thing is on a scale. The alternative, the real pure path, is to live in the woods, make your own clothing, and perhaps eat small game, if you can catch it. You have to choose how much you're willing to put up with for your purposes. So, I am a reluctant participant in the commercial world because that's what they have here, that's the way they keep score, and I'm not about to go live in the woods. If this were a culture where everything was free, I would do this for free. I would go from campfire to campfire, dragging my stone tablet of jokes around for people to see in exchange for pieces of meat. It would be a nicer system. But that's not the way it is.<br> That being said ... In the early '80s I discovered that I had made bad business decisions during the last half of the '70s and was deeply in debt to the IRS. It was still 70 percent tax time. I was behind. The penalties and interest were burying me, and I had no career to speak of. So a friend of mine, a promoter, became my manager, and we began to dig out of this, and it's taken me 20 years. When the people from 10-10-220 came to me, I said, 'Well, it's a phone service, it's not a poison gas, it's not gasoline, let me listen to these people.' They gave me full creative control over the imagery and the content, and they wanted to use me doing my stand-up. So I made what I consider a compromise, or an adjustment. That's my personal euphemism for it -- we all make adjustments to our value system according to our needs and what we can tolerate.'

 1	 3	'even if he is innocent.'<br>Innocent? Do you not understand the concept of a court of law? Y'see what happens is the defendent is put on trial. Evidence against him is presented. If this evidence doesn't hold up he is released without charge. I think I'm going to have to repeat this for you: if he's innocent, he has nothing to worry about. The point is you couldn't give two sh*ts whether he's guilty or not, you want him off the hook.<br><br>'abused by Arab immigrants'<br>This article fails to mention Amnesty is the one building the cases against Israel's war crimes. I take it amnesty is made up entirely of Arab immigrants is it? Perhaps I should further explain the concept of a court of law. The idea is that an impartial party known as the judge ultimately makes the decision weighing up the evidence for and against. The Arab 'barbarians at the gates' don't get to clump together and vote on who is guilty and who is not. <br><br>Here's your problem mate<br>

 1	 3	National Socially Responsible Health Care!!!<br>Whatwe need is nationalized health care that keeps all of the money sucking fat companies totally out of it. All the health care costs should be borne by the country itself since too much time and money is spent figuring out who is responsible for all the carcinogens, pesticides, and everything else in the country that has unknown side effects. And then adding profit margins, advertising, legal costs, CEO benefits onto the cost. Not only that the profit motive makes the first priority of any company the avoidance of coverage as much as possible. That is an insane approach to the health and welfare of a nation and it's national security. As we know we are all affected by the lack of treatment of diseases of everyone else! In an interdependent system everyone needs to have good coverage.<br>It also seems to call in question the motivation of any form of insurance.<br>

 2	 2	Religion is the anchor of moral society! And as moral society is forced to drag that anchor in it's quest for progress.
 2	 2	While these are all good points, if it isn't a project designed to be begun and completed in the short term then it isn't economic stimulus. That would be regular infrastructure building and such spending should be considered in other normal budgetary spending matters. The argument that 'this is our big chance to get a huge chunk of money' doesn't fly, we should not be any less critical of the spending in the stimulus package than we would be spending in the federal budget.

 2	 2	'Thats the point!' <br>I am so happy to have the President stand up for the real world. A stimulus is spending. You can spend it on good things that create jobs or stupid things (like simple rebate checks) that don't. That is a good debate. But 40 Republican lawmakers don't believe this simple fact and voted to remove all spending and replace it with huge tax cuts for rich individuals! Where is the middle ground with that?

He is not an over night cure but he does a good job of giving us the faith in America we need right now. <br><br>BTW. as an Obama supporter, I would be behind McCain had he won because we need a leader at this time in history and anyone willing to do the job deserves respect and admiration.

Make sure the conduct of the police was completely above board, the prosecutors actually turned over all evidence as required, the defense was competent, the judge had no conflict of interest or political agenda and all the forensic tests were done by certified techs on properly calibrated equipment, etc. The conduct of all involved needs to be examined and if it isn't completely above reproach, then the death penalty is off the table and life without parole becomes the maximum sentence.

The fact that this family did all they legally could, had all the right paperwork not to mention the legal expenses that go along with all of that, not to mention 17 years of life shared together and still their was no regard for their relationship, and the fact that they were a 'Family' by hospital staff when one of them was dying, scares the shit out of me, The DOMA laws need to be repealed. I think the involved hospital staff, and the heads of the hospital should all have to go through Diversity sensitivity classes, and I hope the hospital looses this case and has to pay the family an exorbitant amount of money. Sometimes the pocketbook is the best place to hit in order for such lessons to be learned. 
 4	 1	Awesome guitar player!
 1	 3	How much you wanna bet that the mainstream media will never cover this? They're always the first to start yapping whenever something negative comes out about pot, but when some great news like this surfaces, they dig up some extra crap about Jessica Simpson or Hannah Montana to justify their non-coverage of the pro-pot story. The conservatives can drivel on about 'liberal media' all they want - the more apt term would be 'politically correct fear-inciting media.'
 1	 1	Will you seed?
 2	 2	whats the big deal about american apparel? Its not Walmart or Target moving in....<br><br>Probably people with self owned and operated clothes stores that sell stuff similar to AA are the ones that are upset. Locals probably are in favor. 
 1	 2	A tale of a loveless geek.
 1	 2	You'd think all these articles about how the last $700 billion the Government spent is being wasted would erode support for spending another $800 billion in 'stimulus'. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, although in my particular case I opposed both of them, so you didn't fool me so much as you overpowered me.<br>And yes, I realize this is the United Kingdom, but its the same story, just different taxpayers getting screwed.
 1	 2	'Marijuana is illegal because anyone can grow it and there is no real market if it were legal.'<br><br>There are so many things wrong with this statement. <br><br>First of all, I can grow just about anything that I put my mind to. Question? Why isn't Tobacco illegal? Anyone can grow Tobacco, but its perfectly legal. <br><br>Secondly, you MASSIVELY underestimate the market that there would be if Marijuana was legalized.

 2	 3	If I had half a million I'd be set for a long time/ I'd buy some really, really cheap housing right next to a uni.<br><br>Then I'd rent them out for AUD$100 a week. Try and pack each house with 5 or 6 students.<br><br>If I managed to get 2 houses that's maybe 10 students packed tight. That's AUD$1000 a week.

 2	 1	Is the Pope a catholic? He is and yes, sex sells, it always has and always will!
 2	 2	Misleading? Perhaps, but don't judge the speaker harshly. It's rather difficult to explain it succinctly and accurately to the layman. Let me give it a shot.<br><br>The fact is all our best descriptions of the universe treat time and space on a very similar footing. You may choose not to call time a dimension; words are just words, so that's your perogative. But in fact time is something very similar to a dimension, and in the mathematical sense of the word it certainly qualifies. <br><br>In fact the basic difference is, time has a 'minus' sign in a couple of key equations, while the three space dimensions each have a 'plus' sign. (Well, the other difference is it's measured in years instead of meters, but that problem's solvable. One light year is fundamentally one 'year' of distance; that's why physicists use light years!)<br><br>Now it's true, that minus sign makes time a very different beast from space. But in a mathematical sense it's still a dimension, and spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold of some strange structure we don't know everything about yet.
 1	 2	Is that all of them? It doesn't seem like that many for the whole internet.
 1	 4	Now I have a reason to never go to subway, to eat its shitty subs.
 2	 1	Its actually easier to be a web server than it is to be a web client, like Safari. Web services are in their essence very highly specialized FTP built to talk to a custom document viewer, i.e. web browser.
 1	 1	Have you seen the living?
 2	 3	The solution to our problem is to collapse as a nation. People never realize the problem until its too late. THat is perhaps the best medicine.<br><br>Change is such a minor thing,the change anyone was preaching is only the difference of raising or lowering taxes. <br><br>We needed a revolution not some rabbit crap like change.<br>

 1	 1	The Sony PRS-700 has a touch screen.
 2	 2	@lemur: a rented apartment and a popular car are definitely not considered luxury in Brazil. There are a lot of poor people in Brazil, but more than half of the population can afford such things.<br><br>Middle class is very alive in Brazil, especially in the last few years.<br><br>Perhaps you think Brazil is a huge slum (as you might have seen in City of God) and a decent home is rare thing around here. This is far, far away from reality. More than half of brazilians can afford an apartment, a popular or second-hand car, a flat-screen tv, computers (as SteveMax said) and they're not considered luxury.<br><br>If you're talking about these luxuries in a world level (damn, even a hot shower is considered a luxury) then I agree with you. But I'm just saying at Brazil.

 3	 3	WAIT!!!! Heath's dead?!?!?! LOL wow... these people seriously want the joker to never be portrayed again on the big screen? I assume they don't want anymore gay cowboys either? lol... as much as i LOVED Heath's performance as the Joker (and i really mean it, had my doubts, but he truly won be over)... The fact of the matter is I like watched the caped crusader fight the joker.... I feel the reason why Heath's performance was so 'amazing' was cause we have never had a Joker role that was truly meant to be dark, terrifying, and devilishly evil. IDK what runs through peoples head though, even if this does have justification it will never happen.
 2	 2	It's not even about the hardware Vista is just a memory hog, but at $20 a gig I fail to see where the problem is. Can you even get a computer with less than 1GB of ram now?

 1	 2	Presumably you're talking the Laffer Curve, so then you'd know that after a certain optimal taxation rate revenues would start to decrease as tax rates are lowered.<br><br>Knowing this, maybe you can tell me the difference between dropping the top marginal tax rate from 90% (as Kennedy did) and dropping the present top tax rate from 35%.<br><br>Do you think there might be a different effect?
 1	 3	It would be the height of hypocrisy to dump A-Roid now just because what the Yankees knew full well privately when they signed him is now confirmed publicly.<br><br>Is there any mystery when a former Texas player shows up dirty? Can you say Sosa, Palmero, Pudge Rodriguez, Ken Caminiti and of course the poster boy Canseco?<br><br>Just who the hell was running that club, anyway? Whoever it was must be a major league a-hole. I hope nobody like that ends up with a position of any real influence....

 1	 3	Thanks for your input lemur. Many of the diggers don't understand the culture and associate or stereotype all of Islam based on actions found in Saudi Arabia. An equal justification would be the Saudi Arabians to call every Christian pedophiles for sexually assaulting young children. Or to chastise US politicians for viewing child pornography.
 3	 2	People need to understand (and I know there's a vast majority who already do) that guns do not kill people. Years ago (i don't know like 100) children could buy guns, there was barely any restriction on guns and there were less killings than now. It's people with their ideals and motivations that kill.

 3	 3	'thank god LaserDisc didn't catch on'<br><br>WTF? First of all, it pretty much outlasted VHS. More importantly, it was about the best consumer-electronics product ever. At a time when video tape had barely made it into homes, Philips and Pioneer had the guts to develop and commercialize a laser-based optical disc system. IN THE '70s. Let's see: uncompressed video, stereo (and, later, Dolby AC-3) sound, directors' cuts, extras (some even had the entire script of the film on the disc). And no wear. And selling for $35 per movie, when crappy, mono, quickly worn-out VHS tapes were selling for $100.<br><br>LaserDisc could have topped DVD's picture quality if it had offered anamorphic and progressive images, because it was uncompressed. Its primary disadvantage would've been video noise level.<br><br>Hopefully your friends and family don't rely on you for electronics advice.

 1	 2	WRONG there have been almost NO war in which the 2 sides had the same religion.
 2	 2	I'm on the side of the Free Staters, you ninnies! House resolutions are one thing. Actually defending yourself from a belligerent federal government is something else entirely. Several states have brought up this 'declare sovereignty' thing and what does it change? They all still take federal money for their schools, permit unconstitutional federal agencies to meddle in their citizens' lives, and roll over for the exact same jurisdictional power grabs as always.<br><br>What a State *really* needs to do in order for all this celebrating to be justified, is to pass a law that flies directly in the face of unconstitutional federal policies, and back it up with lethal force. For example, New Hampshire could decriminalize marijuana, and arrest any federal agent that attempts to harass anyone for possession.

 1	 2	what amazes me is why this is on digg? VW bluemotion cars have been around for years.
 2	 2	It doesn't have to be a nonprofit, or big volunteer effort. It's the little miracles, the little bits of compassion and energy that we give to others that accumulate in personal excellence everyday and amount to growth of character and strength in spirit. Do unto others is not just an adage but a way of being. And this isn't just for weekend warriors. Think about it the next time you step over a homeless person in the street on your way to where ever. 
 1	 3	The final statement shows that the chief is more concerned about damage control and protecting his 'brothers' than what really happened on that video. A history of violence doesn't excuse excessive force by the officers on that day. I wish more police actually care about justice. 
 2	 3	Ha, that's a fucking accomplishment right there. Finding few-year-old files, it's quite impressive, although understandable.<br><br>The biggest fuck up I've had was accidentally the whole hard drive. I was actuall going to a floppy drive, but I was talking on the phone, distracted, selected the wrong drive, and few clicks later, my hard drive was formatted. I realized that when I saw that file system was set to NTFS, and I was like 'NTFS on a floppy? WTF?' A microsecond later I felt like shooting myself.<br><br>80GB of data, including downloads, MP3s, movies. over 48 hours trying to recover that shit.

 3	 3	It is so much more than a media player, and the player part comes unlocked. Can VLC render straight into a podcast format? Can it create .MOV and .m4v? Mixed with flip4mac can it render .WMV? Can Windows movie player do any of the above?<br><br> Actually can the rather otherwise awesome Widows Media tool you can download for free convert into .mov or .m4v? I think not, wether you pay extra or not.<br><br>I paid for it, and have used it's features to make money since. Can't remember last time i used it to watch a video, and their lies the reasoning i'm sure.<br><br> IF it's unlocked, i wuld have thought watching video through iTunes on a mac is making quicktime irrelevant EXCEPT for rendering video or watching .WMV (A format that is quickly being made pointless). Quicktime Pro mixed with flip4mac studio is an incredibly powerful and inexpensive tool for a video maker.<br><br> Frankly, people moaning about quicktime are not using it to full potential... or are Mac haters jumping on their silly bandwagon. <br><br> No idea what you are talking about people.<br><br>

 1	 2	If we use California as a microcosim of what Liberal Government can do (don't even try to claim that Schwarzy is a real conservative) then I think we can clearly see where the US will be after 8 years of Obama. I don't know what kind of weed they smoke in washington but the idea that we can spend (aka print) our way out of this is patently retarded. The government cannot fix with one payment what it has spent 40 years creating with BAD legislation and spending. Sadly even ending the war really won't help. Sure we'd save all those billions by not having troops abroad, but then we'd have all those troop back home...looking for jobs...where there aren't any.
 1	 1	is it just me or does a guy say 'fuck you' during the news report when they switch to the blond girl?
 1	 2	Also notice in commericals now that any 'bad person' is a 30 something clean cut white male.  They got them breaking into houses and taking a break from jogging to sift through your trash to steal your identity. 
 2	 2	Enough with the hate-mongering. Anything that panders to a stereotype is not 'hate speech'. Yes, women have PMS. Yes, men double up if they get kicked in the balls. Neither observation is hateful.<br><br>Most of these commercials would work well enough with a man/boy as the protagonist too. They are not sexist, just implying their customers are dumb. I remember a commercial where a man was apparently too dumb to work a water filter, and the woman showed him how, smugly. THAT is sexist, but apparently there is only outcry if the roles are reversed. (Of course, it would be sexist the other way round too)<br><br>And of course, I concede the Polyglas tire one IS completely sexist and demeaning, but how old does that have to be, 40 years or more?
 2	 2	Found this pretty interesting:<br><br>Male Bashing in TV<br><br>Just shows how a lot of comedies/sitcoms have a male lead who is an idiot/poor parent/etc. and how in between the commercials have an anti-man vibe to em.<br><br>Thought it was interesting to go against the TV hates women vein.

 1	 2	No. It's not. What we have here are bad decisions by people playing with money that is not theirs. Then, when the bill comes due, we get forced to pay for their bad decisions. The only way out of this spiral is called fiscal responsibility. Which isn't going to happen as long as we worship greed in this country.

 3	 2	Good post Darcine! There are whiners on the left and blowhards on the right - but they need each other. They cancel each other out and keep each other in check. This causes the nation to be centrist over time.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin knew this and talked about it frequently.
 2	 2	.NET should be ditched and Mono should rise, meaning C# people should code toward mono and not .NET. In term what this will do is force Microsoft out of ownership of the C# coding language. Then by C# having no owner it can become as standard as C or C++ that in terms will help developers and 'ALL' users.<br><br>I admit i had a problem against C# because the fact .NET, closed and propetiary, is the main implementation of it. Though with an open implementation combo of C#/GTK#/Qt#(its called something else) i noticed this is actually a good thing, except for the fact Mono is trying ot be a 100% clone of .NET and not try to surpass it that is an issue.<br><br>Basically what i want to see happen with Mono is that it integrates functions and parts from all over into it, basically anyone who builds extentions to Mono-C# don't hesitate to begin integrating these things in the mainline design.<br><br>So pretty much if Mono continues to be brain dead step child of .NET then i can't truly support C#, but if people force Mono as the C# standard then its well worth it.

 1	 2	In order to get Gregg to sign on, Obama promised Gregg he would get the pork out of the so-called stimulus, and he would do a fair and square census. When the grievance mongers started squealing, Obama went back on the census promise and turned it over to Rahm 'Hit-Man' Emmanuel. No warning to Gregg. Then pork-a palooza happened, with Obama fighting for every slice of bacon. Gregg figured out Obama couldn't be trusted, and he got out while the getting was good.

 1	 2	The basis for comparison doesn't hold up. A regular user can go trough 3 lines of coke in about as much time as a drunk takes a swig of beer. So it might be $4-$8 a line but you'll end up doing 15-20 a night (a cokehead's night can end at 3 pm the next day) So if you say that the average drunk will drink 10 beers in a night at about $5 a beer. The cokehead can be out anywhere from 10 - 110 bucks a night over someone just drinking. So it is definitely not cheaper than beer in a real sense.

 1	 3	I'm right there with you, in addition I feel I have a moral obligation (yes, morals have nothing to do with religion) to point out the wrong doings of religion. It's just not right to control people through their insecurities about life and fear of death.<br><br>'I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough - I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race.' - Nietzsche (and I agree with him)

 3	 1	That is actually a really good question even though you were just kidding around (or was it that bad?). I am currently working on a undergrad psych degree and the issue of implanting false memories has come up in many of my courses, but nothing has ever been mentioned about making someone forget past memories. Although I suppose you can try to suppress your past memories on your own if you believe in that whole Freudian thing.

 1	 4	I have come to the conclusion that every god damned person on the internet slept through the section of their English class that covers proper use of the apostrophe.<br><br>fear's = Possessive case - fear becomes the object in possession. (incorrect, as 'fear's' is a noun in this case)<br>fears = Verb, 'fears' gives action to Taliban, making the sentence complete. (also incorrect...)<br>fear = Verb, but now in singular form. (correct case)<br><br>So not only was the apostrophe not needed, but the plural form was incorrect as well.<br><br>I realize there are other errors, but I am getting really fucking sick of people ignoring basic grammar principles and bastardizing the English language. Normally I can handle the occasional slip-up, but this shit is seriously getting out of control.

 2	 1	100 billion trillion Earth-like planets containing life. Amazing. Now how about the other planets that have sentience that isn't defined by the term of 'life' as we know it?
 2	 2	Amazing -- the power of an orbiting fleck of paint. The velocities these particles achieve is astounding. It would seem that 'Kessler' was right - and attention needs to be given to the space debris problem. Somehow, I can't quite avoid picturing a scenario where warring countries decide to blow up each other's communications satellites. A lot of our military weaponry and defense systems rely on satellites for GPS and remote controls, and our ABM systems depend on an intact communication system. So far, Russia, US, and China have all shown that they can blow a satellite to smithereens. So if Star Wars ever gets here, there will likely be too much resulting particulate matter for normal space capability to survive.
 1	 4	I dugg you up, and then read 'I am sure anyone who behaves like this has suffered much to become like they are.' and promptly dugg you back down.<br><br>No, this kid probably didn't suffer fuck all.

 1	 3	And you wonder how the Nazi's could find people to run they're camps. I'm appalled to why the military did not protect the people from a government that behaves like this. When basic liberties are removed and enforced this way by the government and military its own people are the next victims. How many young dead Americans soldiers now? The military should invade that ranch in Texas instead and go after the real problems...
 2	 2	Obama stated many times on his campaign that he wanted to give more funding to Churches and to empower them to help to their communities. I don't know why anybody is surprised by this move. Did you actually listen to what Obama was saying and read about his policy during the campaign or just buy into the ultra left wing image that the media and republicans painted of him?<br><br>Also, despite what you may think, most churces are not the rabid evangelical type and do a lot of good for their communities, especially in inner cities. Obama made his early political career as a community organizer working alongside churches. This is exactly in line with his character.
 1	 2	How many times did the article mention 'occupation'?<br><br>Zero.
 3	 2	McCain has run for President several times and refused to release his records from college or the military. Dumbya didn't release his either, they were leaked. We still haven't seen that glowing record of his AWOL years from the National Guard.<br><br>An NO ONE, I mean NO ONE is even considered for Harvard Law without exceptional records. To be on the Harvard Law Review is reserved for only the top students and to be top dog, editor, we can safely assume that Obama never took a 'History of Television' course in under grad for an easy grad and that he never received as much as an A- in anything he did. Face it, he worked his ass off and he is a very smart man.
 2	 1	Some interesting thoughts concerning Christopher Reeve's Superman
 1	 2	unfortunately i feel this was her death sentence
 2	 2	Coming to bat for Louisiana, TheAmazingKort.<br><br>Well, I have to agree that this is definitely a leap backwards for how the rest of the nation thinks of Louisiana. But just like everywhere else, there are probably going to be more idiots than there are rational thinkers. Included in those idiots just so happens to be our governor. It's a sad state of affairs, but it's a reality for us. I, and many others I know, do not and have not ever supported Bobby Jindal in his decisions to do anything and I for sure didn't vote for the guy.<br><br>So I'm asking nicely, please don't pigeon hole all Louisiana residents, some of us are smart enough to wipe our own asses. 
 1	 3	Bush had been getting intelligence reports since he was elected- 11 months before 9/11 occurred. 9/11 happened during bush's presidency plain and simple. He had plenty of time to do something. Beyond that, just because clinton dropped the ball doesn't actually excuse the fact bush was reading my pet goat during 9/11, I call this kindergarten ethics. Thank god you nut jobs were voted out- say hello to reality GOP.
 2	 2	@TinmanHero - The Bible is the word of God written by MAN. It is a true collection of stories written as lessons. You don't have to take the actual words literally to be a believer. I am a Christian but I don't think that the heavens, Earth and everything was created in 7, literal, days. Seven days could be tens or hundreds of thousands, or millions, of years. 'Soon' is given as the time when Jesus will return and we all know that soon to us obviously isn't 'soon' to God as it's been a couple thousand years so far. As an engineer I am well aware of the mountains of evidence of evolution and fully believe it to be true as well. The two are not mutually exclusive.<br><br>You will say that it awfully convenient that we can't prove God exists. But I tell you this...It's awfully convenient that something is either fully, literally, true or it isn't true at all. I think you need to think more fully, and critically, about the possibilities that exist rather than claiming something isn't true because there is no proof, without any proof of your own.

 2	 2	The human being created civilization not because of willingness but of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning. The individual desires judgment. Without that desire, the cohesion of groups is impossible, and so is civilization. First, judgment came from the gods. Then, it came from celebrity (the observation and judgment of others). Now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms - our next judge will probably be an omni-present self-aware system that we build ourselves, which eerily echos Voltaire.

Is this really a problem for anyone who isn't well entrenched in the gaming industry? I have no idea what the writer is talking about as he cites no examples, and it amazes me that everyone on this thread is more or less agreeing also without providing any examples except for yahtzee.

While I'd say (as an Oregonian and a beer drinker) this is too minimal, and I *would* support a tax increase (we have such a budget shortfall here they're talking about closing all the public schools in April because we can't afford to keep 'em open), an 1800% jump isn't a reasonable amount in my book.<br><br>It should be stated for the record that a barrel of beer equals two kegs, so a $50 tax per barrel works out to $25 per 15.5 gallon keg, or about 20 cents per pint at a bar.<br><br>Of course, area brewers here are claiming it's going to raise the cost of a pint by $2, which is ridiculous.
 1	 2	Sorry, not the case. This cop did everything he could to get Phelps arrested, but in the end there just was not enough evidence.

I actually know some people that would back away and yell advice, or run. <br><br>This one guy I know, he's not my friend, but three other friends and I lured him into the woods and then one of the friends appeared out of nowhere and started 'raping' our other friend. Three to one, you'd think the plan would be to take the 'rapist' on, but no, this guy was scared shitting bricks and wanted to run. Then again the fact he doesn't respect women's rights and stuff might have been a factor. Still, I wouldn't depend on him to stand up to a five year old. I don't think he ever went near the woods again. 
 1	 2	The rest is protectionist claptrap. It does not seem to occur to Buchanan that jobs are lost and gained in a vibrant economy. Prior to this depression, we lost a huge number of manufacturing jobs because of automation. According to Dr. Sowell, China lost the same percentage of manufacturing jobs that we did.<br><br>
 2	 2	It was the individual who believed the cat 'felt there was something wrong.' And you're debating on the cats 'knowledge' ?! Now, if you're really paying attention you'll put together a few things; notice that it is mentioned the cancer was in an early stage, and could have gone undetected for five or more months. The cats behavior must have seemed random or spontaneous to the individual (hence his concern being triggered by an event which wasn't normal). You can very reasonably assume that cat may have sensed a *difference* in the owners 'state' from one point in time to another. The cat doesn't need to think there's something 'wrong,' I'm sure if the cats senses were capable of detecting oder from the cancer then it was simply recognizing and curious about a change, nothing more.<br><br>The question of 'good' or 'bad' is irrelevant, it's people who determine that subjectively, well all animals eventually learn it hence being able to avoid danger. It could be just a coincidence, albeit an incredible one, the cats behavior was apparantly as 'recently odd' as the cancer within this individuals lungs.<br><br>It's possible this is a coincidence, and evidence from research suggests it may not be. I'm not going to make a decision either way, I'll just appreciate the new information I've been able to consume and learn more about it in time.<br><br>The important question is; 'could the cat have detected the cancer?' - Where on the body the cat was scratching is the only place I see the greatest possibility for coincidence. The detection of the cancer itself may very well have been real and without the need for the cat to 'believe it was a bad thing.'<br><br>IMHO.

 2	 2	It's time to stop playing the blame game. What Bush has done might have been bad but I honestly believe in Obama's message of bipartisanship and understanding. Everything we do should be for the state, and a case against Bush would divide the country in twain (yes, I just wanted to say 'twain'). A case like that would make it difficult for ANY Republicans (who answer to their constituency) to work on economic packages with Democrats. <br><br>I don't think it's fair to let Bush off the hook, but right now his 'crimes' are less important than saving our economy, soldiers, and rights.

The more they give you, the bigger the problem will be, as it artificially influences the housing market and encourages bad spending for short term gains and huge long term losses, not only from the buyers, but those who own the properties or intend to invest, particularly in low income housing construction. It will lead to a housing stagflation.

As much as we need speed to fix the policies which authorized the many abuses of civil liberties the decisions need to be tempered with an aim to the future to prevent these abuses from happening again. Having said that, the President has made some decisions which are clearly contrary to the goal of restoring all civil liberties, eliminating the poisonous policies and protecting us in the future. <br><br>I intend to continue to read about his decisions and if they do not show a clear direction toward restoration of our civil liberties very soon I am likely to be marching in the streets with the 'radicals.'<br><br>And after reading the testimony of Spc. Brandon Neely and realizing that we still have people who have been in those cages (see the picture in the following) for 6 or 7 years every day counts. <br>This is not just a national embarrassment it becomes a crime to which all of us are a party if we do not take steps to urge our elected officials to take action. AND to open investigations and prosecutions.

 2	 2	The 50's and 60's had the highest percentage of union jobs in American history . It was also when Americans as a whole had the highest standard of living and the country was at the height of its prosperity.

The Reaganomics idea that making people poor somehow benefits the economy... well, we've seen how that's worked out, haven't we?

 1	 2	'the assertion that some of the spending in the bill isn't stimulus'<br>Media Matters thinks that anytime the government spends money on ANYTHING that stimulates the economy. In economics this is called the Fallacy of the Broken Windows. The idea that if a store gets it's windows broken and has to fix them this stimulates the economy.<br><br>Not true. The storeowner has to spend money, but if not for the broken window he could have spent that money on something else.<br><br>Does Media Matters believe the government should pay people to dig holes and then fill them in? Imagine how many people THAT would put to work? Of course, that's silly. But in the same way, we believe, and Fox News explains, that spending on useless projects is NOT stimulative.<br><br>Government spending projects didn't work in the 30s. Didn't work in Japan in the 90s. Never worked in the now-defunct Soviet Union. It's really never worked. And it's crazy to gamble everything we have on the chance that the very first time in history that it will work would be now.
 1	 3	Libs... always emotional, always race baiting.. An idiot is someone who voted for and signed a bill that nobody even read.. The Dems love to bypass the normal procedures to push their liberal agendas by back handed tactics like this or putting activist Justices on the bench. They hate to have things (like the things written into this Pork/Stimulus bill) actually go through the proper legislative process so we all would see what is being proposed and debated then voted on.. <br><br>They insult the Constitution and every American ... Even if they had to find new people to write the bill, it would be the same BS by the same extreme radical leftost partisan Democrats.. Too bad. I left the party because of the leftist/Marxists who are in charge now.... They all are embarrassments to the party and the country.. Sharpton is one of the biggest embarrassment. The American people made a big mistake on election day and maybe now they will be finding out the truth and buyers remorse will set in..

 1	 2	So the enviro whacks and politically correct wannabes in government think that someone is going to sell off a perfectly good vehicle that they own and has payments of $0.00/month so they can go into debt to the tune of $20,000-$40000 just to 'save' on fuel costs and taxes? Once again (as usual) the sqeaking wheels are living in their own version of reality.<br>Gas isnt going to stay cheap forever. Offer the vehicles that get better mileage at a reasonable price, not the price of a split-level home. If need be, subsidise them to keep the $$ within reason. Apply tax Cuts to encourage purchases. Its amazing how things can happen automatically with honey rather than vinegar.<br><br>
 2	 2	We're going to have the 2 party system for many years to come, not much you or I can do about it. <br><br>I got more money from Bush's tax cuts + stimulus than I will from Obama's $13 a week - and I'm middle class. So I'll take the Republicans over the Democrats, financially speaking.
 1	 4	READ THE ARTICLE IDIOT
 1	 2	It's a compromise. It minimizes the loss, doesn't negate it. If the plan was to compensate mortgage companies to for the full amount that they would have made off of the shady loan, we'd have to set up a few more printing presses to print all the money needed.<br><br>From my understanding there are many banks &amp; mortgage lenders who would like to renegotiate the terms but are not being allowed to by the holding company that backs up the loan. This program allows the bank or mortgage company to turn the loan completely over to Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac for the cost of $1,000. The holding company is the big loser here, but they are the ones who established the rules that got is in this trouble in the first place.

 2	 2	Some thought that Blue Ray was going to save the day cause it was better quality (audio and picture) but truth is that consumers really don't care or know about quality but rather prefer convenience. Take a look at the music industry. Audio CD's are much better quality than streaming or down loadable (mp3 files) still consumers are downloading or ripping songs from itunes and other online sites sacrificing audio quality for portability and On-demand needs. Hollywood is not dead. The maker of electronic equipment are. What the people are asking for are TVs with direct online connection and great software interface to download, stream, play , watch , hear and browse anytime any media.

 1	 2	From the Catechism of the Catholic Church Section II Paragraph 2358:<br><br>'The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.' <br><br>You are fully within your rights to disagree with the premise that homosexuality is 'objectively disordered' (make sure you know what that means first though), but you cannot say that the Church calls for torture or anything approaching that.

I honestly would love to vote Democrat for my very first time in 2012, because it will mean we had a good four years.<br><br>But here I am, I'm getting my taxes together and I'm getting squeezed, I don't even know how I'm going to get the money together to pay what I owe because it's been a tough year and all I can keep thinking of is, we have a tax cheat at the head of the IRS. What the hell???<br><br>Is this change we can believe in?

 2	 3	I really want you to grasp what I'm trying to say here. I say you 'leach' off of our healthcare because we're the only group of people providing the constant breakthroughs in medical technology and treatments. If it weren't for our FREE MARKET SYSTEM advancing the system in leaps and bounds, we'd all be using leaches to cure cancer still. I say you leach off of us because although you obviously have to buy the technology, that doesn't help create anything new so you in fact contribute nothing to the system. And if you won't accept the WIDELY KNOWN FACT that the healthcare and quality of treatment for serious diseases is so much more superior in the USA than there's no point in arguing any further.<br><br>I said give me examples of government run programs that aren't bested by private sector counterparts. There aren't ANY. EVERY SINGLE example of government run programs that actually have an equivalent private sector alternative always comes in behind that alternative. Look at UPS and Fedex compared to the USPS for example.

 2	 3	Just what the world needs, another nuclear arms race. Thing is, what seems to be complicating matters is that so many countries can claim they are merely developing alternative energy sources because of the dwindling fossil fuel supply. But nuclear is so expensive, and potentially very dangerous (remember Chernobyl and Three Mile Island?). Because of the efforts made by Big Oil over the past 30 years, solar power has never been seriously considered although it certainly deserves to be, along with wind technology. <br><br>The most worrisome factor in this whole mess is the fear that is being deliberately spread by the media and by the government. We have to stop this war machine, and not just drink the noxious kool-aid being served up on this issue.

 2	 2	Actually, people will buy a car from a company in bankruptcy protection if the government or 3rd party issues a guarantee. People will not buy a car from a company that has a very high probability of filing for bankruptcy the next month. Because then their warranty is at risk of being wiped by the bankruptcy filing. I'd rather have the government spend money issuing a guarantee on the cars and then Chapter 11. It is a lot cheaper than fueling all the existing legacy costs.

 1	 2	I doubt there will be another strike. The basis for the original strike was a provision in writer's contracts for royalties gained by digital distribution, including DVD sales percentages (which they found to be too low and were an antiquated measurement based on antiquated production costs of VHS tapes) as well as Internet streaming and other distribution channels. <br><br>Writers were the main cause of the strike since a great deal of their money seems to come from royalties.

Complete crashing, like what we've seen in Detroit, is not a good thing and I don't mind the government working to make that not happen. I know two people who foolishly got adjustable rate mortgages and now can't afford them at their higher rates. Numbers would obviously have to be run, but to me it makes more sense to readjust these people's mortgages to fixed rate than to have people, who could pay a lower fixed rate, default on their loans. For those who simply bit off more than they could chew (e.g. making $50K a year, yet got a $500K loan), let them sink or swim on their own.

 1	 3	Unfortunately the ego of us Indians is bigger than our desire to fix our s@#t. This hoopla by some Indians is because they don't want their dirty laundry displayed in public.

 1	 2	I think the address range of IPv4 is the least of our problems. That can be solved by moving to IPv6.<br>The bigger problem is going to be Domain Name Lookup (DNS) and having a human readable name for all those addresses. Already the word-like combinations for domains are pretty much exhausted and strange words appear (eg. Digg.com).<br>Assume every device has a unique IPv6 address on the internet. How are you going to remember the address of your home computer for example. It will be something like 2df8:3ebc:7c6a:b82c:6eb3:276d:75a4:3d2c when most people are lucky to remember their home phone number. MyPC.StreetAddress.MyTown.Com would be memorable and unique, but who wants to give away that information on the net.<br>DNS is global, so lookups based on 'unique' factors like your name won't work. There's most likely a thousand other who shares the same name as you. The Internet is going to need a better directory service!<br><br>

 1	 2	@Rafikichi The dollar is not in the equation. I realize that dollars/pounds/yen are just pieces of paper whose values can be bubbles or (like the American dollar probably soon will) rapidly devalue.<br><br>Gold/silver are like currency in many ways though. They do have the advantage that, since it is difficult to print gold the market isn't likely to get flooded with gold - but many minerals and stones share this characteristic.What makes gold so special? It's all in our heads - just like every other bubble. <br><br>Land is even more difficult to print than gold. It grows more scarce with increases in population. Houses often come with land and represent a significant amount of labor. If one owns a home with a value of 'x' they will enjoy far more benifits than a person who owns a sum of gold with an equal value. The housing bubble was dumb but not as dumb as the gold bubble. <br><br>I'm not saying buying gold is necessarily stupid - you can get very rich off of bubbles as many did with housing - just be aware that they pop.<br><br>Also wealth is destroyed. Depreciation, vandalism, consumption (eg. food), and reduction in number of services provided all destroy wealth. I believe what you are getting at is that wealth doesn't instantly evaporate unless ICBMs are launched. It is important to be aware that these factors do erase wealth because as a recession or depression wears on they will force some gold owners to cash in their investment to replace other assets. This will cause gold to start consistently losing value. This will cause a loss of confidence in the bubble - then it will pop.

 1	 2	It sounds like in Ms Krause's case they won't make any money. Maybe they thought it would be a big bust and worth the money. I dunno.<br><br>In a drug bust, the property of the one busted, or unclaimed property found at the site, or even the land itself, can be forfeit. It depends on a million things, but the basics are if there's a criminal conviction in drugs, then it opens up the money game. This may only be with felonies, which may go toward Ms. Krause's words about the sheriff expecting 500 plants instead of her 24.<br><br>Anyway, assuming many things:<br>* Bust somebody and later there's a conviction<br>* The county then sues the (new) felon in civil court using the criminal conviction as evidence<br>* Based on that evidence, the county gets the land, the car found there, etc.<br><br>It's very big money. While drug cases have special provisions to make it easier for the government to get the goods, it can also apply to other crimes. Such as if somebody robs a bank, the county can sue to get the car that was used in the crime. Otherwise, the car would (should) be returned after the case is over, even if the person is convicted.<br><br>For drug cases, many times law enforcement is able to find a boatload of cash. Not for Ms Krause's 24 plants, but if they find a briefcase full of money, the county sues, gets the cash, and then they buy more ambulances, firetrucks, police cars, oak desks for the city counsel, etc.<br>

I'm sure it's fun to be apart of the whole new age movement, but ignoring real problems so that you can avoid those evil pills and that evil therapy for people who have REAL MENTAL CONDITIONS so that you're nonconformist is wrong. <br><br>There's a difference between feeling blue and unipolar depression.

Why do this when we already have many drugs that work GREAT in conjunction with therapy?

 1	 2	Why would you want to compile a program on a phone? The developer cross-compiles it on his computer and distributes a binary. Since it will be an uniform software platform, there will be no need to compile locally in any way. This has worked for ages on CE devices such as the GP2x, Nokia 770/N800/N810, Pandora, Android, LiMo phones, etc.<br><br>Just because you can compile if you want doesn't mean you have to. Case in point: you CAN compile Firefox on your Windows PC. How many people actually do that?

And second, as previously stated, the Federal Reserve is a private corporation. But things get tricky with its involvement with the government. So let me explain, in particular with the Federal Reserve Police:<br><br>Federal Reserve Police are Federal Law Enforcement Officers to protect and safeguard the premises, grounds, property, personnel, including members of the Board, of the Board, or any Federal Reserve Bank, and operations conducted by or on behalf of the Board or a reserve bank.<br><br>So yes, Federal Reserve Police are FEDERAL OFFICERS and have the rights as such. Don't believe me? Check out United States Code Title 12 Chapter 3 Part II Section 248(q)

 1	 2	See fungie5's response for some of the reason they don't do this. Basically the shuttle parachute works because it only has to safely slow the plane from a pretty slow speed that is just above the minimum speed the shuttle can 'fly' at. It only has to work in one orientation to the horizon (horizontal nose forward). And the shuttle frame is built like a mac truck compared to an airplane that is built like a bird. There is only one place the frame of an airplane could possibly withstand the forces generated by a parachute deployment, and that is at the root of the wings on the spar. Not an ideal placement for a parachute.

 2	 3	It's one thing to copy minor or common features not available for Macintosh browsers. I'm fine with that.<br><br>The problem is when Apple rips off a feature and pretends they are the ones who thought of it in the first place. On the feature list, they claim they are the first browser to pass Acid3 compliance. No, they are using the Webkit engine which passed on the same day that Opera's engine passed as well. They say they are the first browser able to integrate with RSS feeds. Actually, Opera and Firefox both have been utilizing RSS technology long before Safari implemented that feature.<br><br>Those are only several examples of their hubris but there's about a dozen more of these white lies spread throughout their marketing. I'm ok with feature copying as a form of flattery, but Apple has a bad habit of misrepresenting the facts to make it look like they were the innnovators when in actuality they are just pissing on the shoulders of giants.

 1	 2	What part doesn't make sense? I do have some microbiology classes under my belt do you?<br><br>Bacteria of all sorts are not good for you in certain doses. Good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too. We call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health. When their numbers are too great they cause disease. Whole milk spoils as well.<br><br>Outside of the environment they are acclimatized to (adapted to) the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow. Many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk. Part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk.<br><br>Think of yeast infections. Yeast is a natural part of the fauna of human female genitalia but when there is a sudden shift in numbers or a PH shift which kills the yeast you can get an infection of either an over abundance of natural yeast or different strains of yeast.<br><br>

There have been several recent documentaries that have law enforcement officials admitting they are losing 'the war on weed' even billions continued to be spent on this failed effort. Maybe we should stop looking down on a natural herb that goes from Mother Nature and start looking up to how legalization can help the hungry, sick and homeless - not to mention our overall economic situation. A sustainable America is possible if the federal government would allow it. Come on President Obama, do whats right for America, this is one law we CAN'T afford to keep on the books.

 1	 2	The thing you have left out of your analysis is the criminal behavior being engaged in by hedge funds. They have worked in cahoots with the analyst firms and even financial journalists to destroy public companies for gain. Since the removal of the uptick rule in 2007, short sellers have run rampant in the market. They took down a perfectly healthy Bear Stearns in a couple of days, for example, which would have been impossible with the uptick rule in place. You may think this is a conspiracy article, but it was written by a former treasury secretary:<br><br>Personally I'm getting out of the stock market completely until they reinstate this rule.

1	 2	'Congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit. It also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary. ' 'We should remember that HMOs did not arise because of free-market demand, but rather because of government mandates. The HMO Act of 1973 requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees HMO coverage, and the tax code allows businesses – but not individuals – to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums. The result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance, which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage.' 'While many in Congress are happy to criticize HMOs today, the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the American people by federal law. As usual, government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences, but Congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws. Instead, we are told more government – in the form of “universal coverage” – is the answer. But government already is involved in roughly two-thirds of all health care spending, through Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. ' 'The following are bills Congress should pass to reduce health care costs and leave more money in the pockets of families: '

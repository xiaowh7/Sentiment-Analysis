2	3	i was thinking... everyone is allways saying that they want racism to end and that all racist should burn in hell or something along that nature yet has anyone stopped to think that maybe people who are racist also want racism to end, they're just acting on there idea's instead of sitting on their a**'s all day. just a thought. i thought it was kind of ironic once i stopped to think about it.its realy kind of funny when you stop to think about it yourself

2	1	Thanks! You can, but it'd be more like the "Fred" from "Scooby Doo" Freddie Prinze. Anytime you're home, let me know, and we can play.
3	1	simply amazing.
2	3	If I didn't know better I'd say you wrote this, anyway thought you might like it. ----- ----- Now I sit me down in school ----- ----- Where praying is against the rule ----- For this great nation under God ----- Finds mention of Him very odd. ----- ----- If Scripture now the class recites, ----- It violates the Bill of Rights. ----- And anytime my head I bow ----- Becomes a federal matter now. ----- ----- Our hair can be purple, orange or green, ----- That's no offense; it's a freedom scene. ----- The law is specific, the law is precise. ----- Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice. ----- ----- For praying in a public hall ----- Might offend someone with no faith at all. ----- In silence alone we must meditate, ----- God's name is prohibited by the state. ----- ----- We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks, ----- And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. ----- They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible. ----- To quote the Good Book makes me liable. ----- ----- We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen, ----- And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King. ----- It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong, ----- We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong. ----- ----- We can get our condoms and birth controls, ----- Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles ----- But the Ten Commandments are not allowed, ----- ----- No word of God must reach this crowd. ----- ----- It's scary here I must confess, ----- When chaos reigns the school's a mess. ----- So, Lord, this silent plea I make: ----- Should I be shot; My soul please take! ----- Amen

2	1	It was a late night in the club; she was winding and spinning around the pole as if she was an angle on ice. Her audience was amazed as she was able to bend in many ways. Ruby twirled around once more as her hair moved with her body. The music filled the place and there was more drunk bastards filling the place then usual, she watched from the corner of her eye as they tried to get a feel when she bent forward. She placed both hands on the pole as she pulled herself up she bent backwards spreading her legs apart slowly moving down the pole. She spun to the bottom as she finished her routine. Claps and whistles from the men filled the room. She smiled as she walked down the stairs and over towards the bar where she got herself a Martine.

2	1	Ashlee laughed as she closed the door to the joining rooms and laughed "Sorry nope, It's ashlee, jennifer isn't here yet, and she wouldn't be coming in from that door" Ashlee said with a laugh as she pointed to the door that she just came through. Krys seemed a little different then Ashlee thought but she'd learn to deal and like this girl. Ashlee went over and sat down on one of the two beds that were in the room looking out the window. ----- ----- There was a bird that landed on the railing of the balcony that was for the two joining rooms, and Ashlee smiled. Then she looked back at Krys putting all of her things in the dresser and hanging shit up. Why bother hanging things up if you dont need to? "So you stayin for the whole summer to?" Ashlee asked her. It was June 20th. The first day that everyone was going to be there, but some of the people had to leave early, ashlee just wanted to make sure the Krys wasn't one of them

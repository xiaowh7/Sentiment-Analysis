on hold for another half hour. phone is ringing but no one is picking up.@apple you stink.
@Apple would do better to inform customers properly about migrating to #iCloud - many complaints lead to #image damage http://t.co/QL7zmPpO
@apple does iOS 5 rape your battery life? or am I just using my phone a lot since getting it
@samsung, @apple, you do realise you're just really pissing off the customer base AS WELL AS looking petty.
@Apple - why do I have to have apps I am updating in their original 'folder' location? That was painful.
@apple domain fail. Open 2 hrs late for walk in ppl. Store was empty and i only need a skin 4 my screen. You represent customer service FAIL
@BrianMincey @apple the chipsets tear through battery life. Coworker has a htc thunderbolt that he gets about 3 hours of life.
I wish the Apple updater would stop trying to ram iTunes down my throat. I don't own a pissing iPhone @apple
Is it me or does my #iPhone run slower since the #iOS 5 update? @apple @Verizon
Just searching with my voice on my 2 year old nexus one @apple.
@apple, your update server has been timing out for a week. i had to force a restore w/the new #iOS5 software. lost all my stuff. thanks!
Thanks to a 90 minute wait on hold, half an hour actually talking to someone, the @Apple tech decides to send me an email to fix my phone
I am very upset about and inconvenienced by this iphone update failed backup. @iphone @apple
but seriously @apple finance me a damn phone you greedy bastards! OR Santa...get your jolly ass in gear and get us a 4S - white plz
My schedule is 2 busy 2 spend UNquality time with @ATT @Apple 2 recover Iphone again-The mo' mobile I get the mo' immobile I is. Sync Not!
Pondering the iOS update... From the sounds of @MikeFerri's difficulties, I may just hold off :/ @Apple, FIX IT!
@twalve @apple you know the issues they have with DST and alarms :p
Why book @Apple Genius Bar if after 2.5 hours you still can't be served. Disappointing Apple Store Sydney. #thanksfornothing
Apparently @Apple genius training doesn't extend to clocks & service. They're half an hour late for my appointment and couldn't let me know?
Thanks @apple for an OS update that has only succesfully bricked my iPod.
screw you @apple iOS 5. I can't download this crap, and I'm tired of trying. Get this problem figured out about my connection timing out
Wow. iCloud's mail is down. 1st the iOS 5 upgrade issues and now this. I really hope this isn't @apple without Steve Jobs.
@apple  why don't you guys test your upgrades before you put them out. 15 1/2 hrs u guys wasted of my time yesterday. Thanks.
what is going on with all my @Apple products?! First my #iPad freezes (still is frozen) and then my #iPhone won't turn on!!! #techieTroubles
2nd @apple genius apptment running late 2nd day in row for 2nd dodgy iPod . You make mega $$$ hire some staff.
It took @apple about 7 years just to figure out how to properly syncronize an iPhone.  WOW!  #ios5
@apple So I went to the 5th Ave store and was told I could wait about 4 hours to get a 4S. Needless to say I'm back at the hotel relaxing.
Overall I am a fan of the iPhone 4S; however, my Siri has issues connecting to the network @Apple
Terrible customer service at Los Gatos @Apple! Why do I have to pay $199 for a bad home button on my iPhone?!?
Having major battery drain issue since updating iPhone 4 to iOS 5.  Anyone else? @AppStore @iPhone @apple
Dear @apple please send me my Mac Book back surely the repair is done by now... Thanks!
@apple thanks for ios5 - loving having my music breaking up like I'm talking on a mobile (cell) phone. Bring back functional 4 #iosdonwgrade
@Apple, #iOS5 #geolocation Suburbs with 2 words drops Map Pins in other States! Please fix.
Sorry @apple, but #iMessage will never be what #BBM is. Disappointed.
Iphone 4s siri doesn't work for shit @apple
@semilshah yeah except that when you ask for a receipt, it takes them 30 minutes to figure out where it printed out. Fix that, @Apple!
RT @JDougyJ: hey @apple do you wanna fix my fucking playlist order, you piece of shit
Bummer!  My @Yahoo! iPad fantasy football app keeps crashing; not sure if it's the app or the new @apple iOS 5. Only two apps running.
@Apple can suck my dick gotta restore my ipad #annoyed
The line at the @apple is just STUPID
@nansen Man, that sux! @apple io5 upgrade a total #fail for you!
Dear @Apple Contacts, you are terrible. I just cleaned duplicates for 3 hours and they magically reappeared. Fix it.
Is it too much to ask which app is incompatible, @apple? http://t.co/yKqip7nk
Pissed with whoever designs keyboards with @apple for not having a home and end key.  working on the CLI i use those keys often
@NoVaTyler @apple Most of mine are gone too! Not recovered after I saved them b4 I upgraded my iPhone! Soooo pissed!
Siri is having a hard time remembering who my sister is. contact card needs space for family info. #iPhone4S @apple
#ios5 getting sloppy @apple. U need to check your QA team. Too many issues with apps, data and syncing
RT @nansen: so this SMS full message is known @apple issue with new iOS5 update. trying restore. When all else #fail - restore.
So glad that I paid $69 for this @apple care protection plan.  Been on hold for over 20 minutes now.  Great customer service. #NOT
not happy with @apple right now. the upgrade to my itouch4 took out my itouch and laptop. #help
@twitter can you look at problem on iPad where it won't open @ messages. It just crashes the app. You too @apple maybe your fault.
@apple What's the point of iCloud wireless updates when ios5 now forces me to use the computer to charge my ipod touch now? #worstupdateever
@robert_terpstra no worries bud, ps: they're saying that the 4s is having a lot of network issues right now. (I'm @apple for mac problems)
I hate you @apple for not sending Toledo,oh @bestbuy any @iPhone for @verizon even after I pre ordered!!!
@pmphillips @apple If my non-Apple equipment broke this often, I guess I'd need an Asus genius bar. But it doesn't, so I don't :-)
Why is the new @apple iPhone OS duplicating all my iCal events? There's 2 of everything. How do I fix it? (tried turning iCloud off)
Dear @Apple, how convenient/handy/thoughtful/smart that after iPhone #ios5 update you're apps won't work anymore! (none!!!) :( #gr%\mbl^.%)
Hey @Apple...I know Steve Jobs died & all but my Twitter for iPad app keeps crashing...Fix it...NOW..please..lol -F.Light
@apple not happy with Apple today. I did the suggested software update and now nothing works!!!
Smashed yet another #iPhone screen. When are @apple gonna make the phone more durable!!! Tired of fixing it myself!!!
I sure as hell better be able to restore my calendar events. Terrible bug apple! @apple #icloud #anothericloudfail
Dear @Apple.inc Facetime doesn't work in here, Fuck You
I really hate that @apple won't let you hide the Newsstand app or move it into a folder. It serves no purpose for me.
Life was much easier when @apple and @BlackBerry were just fruits!
@apple No location reminders on ipad2! That was the point of updating to iOS 5
Comparing @Office #live with @google #apps and @apple #iCloud , I do not see #iCloud leading the crowd. Do you agree ?
Turns out my computer isn't as fixed as it is meant to be. Fuck you @Apple, I'm going back to your Genius Bar to complain. #annoyed
If @apple doesn't fix iOS5 this week, I'm buying a droid #emptythreats
@apple pls launch #Siri on iphone4 .. Disappointed after spending hours for upgrading to iOS5..
@apple you can suck it you and your fucking iPhones better be glad it's all I like cause the service Is fucking terrible
This is the first time I've been unhappy with any @apple product... Disappointed, and the Internet seems as confused as I am right now.
After a week or so with @Apple's #iOS5 I'm considering going back to #jailbroken 4.2 - same features as 5, plus more. Not as stable, though.
Had issues with #Siri reaching network today. Too many uses or my signal? @apple
The new iOS5 completely failed at upgrading the phone. Now I'm stuck in this restore loop. Thanks @apple for wasting my day. Can i undo?
Is it me or does #iPhone4s run a little warm sometimes? @apple
@apple WTF why can we not add the newsstand to a folder?! We are already in your walled garden, so please don't remind us of it.
@apple just now seeing none of my Microsoft Office programs work anymore after Lion upgrade. Why??
Dear @Apple, I don't want the newsstand icon on my screen. #notcool
@Blackberry does take better quality photos than @Apple iPhone though. I give them that! #photograhersEye
Ok @iTunesMusic idk wth is up but after syncing my phone my album art is out of order! WTF @Apple!
I wish Siri could tweet for me . @apple fix that .
@apple I'm still waiting for you to deliver my phone to @sprint
I will never purchase another @Apple product for the rest of my life. I am glad Steve Jobs is fucking dead. MAY YOU FUCKING ROT IN HELL!!!!!
Thanks to @Apple my new iMac is a brick. I cannot re-install Lion and I cannot purchase it because it was installed by the former owner.
Asked #Siri "Where's Baby Lisa?" and was told "sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the network right now." @apple server fail. #ios5
Only thing #iOS.5 has done is deleted my tiger woods game and made impossible to retrieve. Thanks @Apple!
Damn you @apple for breaking wififofum! It continued to work in ios 4. Was one of my most used apps. Damn Apple's overbearing policies!
yo, @apple, this update is a disaster
Dear @Apple,Congratulations, I am suing my insurance company and you just managed to make it to the top of my shit list. #Ineedthosepictures
Dear @Apple: You must let me turn off iCloud to save bandwidth and NOT delete EVERY document on my iPad. That's BULLSHIT!

Now @apple won't let me use credit on @iTunes unless I have a credit card. Should have told me when I redeemed the cards. Sound fair to you?
@amandbrar @apple Siri has worked for me less than 10% of the time. If service doesn't improve by Monday, I'm returning my iPhone 4S.

90 minutes after being at 100% my iPhone 4 (post #ios5 upgrade) has lost 40% of its charge and the @apple store folks are out of ideas.
So "cutting the cord" makes podcasts even harder to manage?!? No subscriptions! WTH, @Apple? http://t.co/LD2i871x #iOS5 (via @carrypad)

In less than an hour my post- #iOS5 iPhone has gone from 100% to 73% battery charge and the @apple store folks have no solution for me :(
Well @apple seems 2b screwing #iphone 4s resellars. They still dont have 4s. Yet were promised. Similar 2 Ma Bell's monopolistic prctices?
Also @EricGreenspan, don't forget @Apple stop closing the app store after each bloody purchase...
*sigh* @apple store seems stumped what to do about my catastrophically bad battery life after upgrading to #ios5
Hmmmm a lot of #Siri features don't work in Canada. Location and directions? Seriously @apple come on!
@apple, #siri can't connect to the network -- it's LESS useful that VoiceControl now... :(
@apple took my Siri and made it exclusive to iPhone 4S  #SoRude

This does not bode well. After charging all night, my @Apple iPhone 4S has 25% battery after only 3hr off charger with no calls & light use
